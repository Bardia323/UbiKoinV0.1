# UbiKoinV0.1
A simple working blockchain API. No Private/Public keys or visual interface.

## About The Project
blockchain.py is a simple API for a fictional blockchain named UbiKoin. It can mine blocks, add a new block to the blockchain, check if a block is valid, connect_nodes, and add_transactions.
It is designed to be simple to understand, but cannot scale to large numbers of transactions or deal with faster than real time speed.
